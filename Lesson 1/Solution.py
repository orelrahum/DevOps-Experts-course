# Create a variable name first with value 7.
first = 7

# Create a variable name second with value 44.3.
second = 44.3

# print results
print(f"first value is :{first}\nsecond value is {second}")
print(f"result of adding first to second :{first + second}")
print(f"result of multiplying first by second :{first * second}")
print(f"result of dividing second by first :{second / first}")

a = 8
a = 17
a = 9
b = 6
c = a + b
b = c + a
b = 8

# print results
print(f"a value is {a}\nb value is {b}\nc value is {c}")
